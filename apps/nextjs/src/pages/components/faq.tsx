It also has the countdown timer until matches are updated for everyone at your school, which happens once a week. The page one to the right is the swiping page, where you can use your swipes to register whether you like a person or not. It also features a report button, which you should use to report users you believe violate our policies or terms. The far right page is where you can purchase tokens which can be used to enhance your Swoop experience. The page one left of the center is the dream match page. This is where monthly you can choose one person that is your "dream" and if you match we\'ll tell you instantly for free! On the far left page you can view upcoming promos and events, as well as, access your account information.',
