        "Swoop streamlines dating by making it as simple as saying yes or no to a person through one click while remaining anonymous. Swoop also uses a clever algorithm to speed up your matching by showing people we think you are more likely to match with.",

      header: "No Risk",
      description:
        "Matches are only displayed when you like a person, and they like you back. Therefore, if you like someone, they'll never know you like them until they say they like you tooâ€”a great way to avoid awkward conversations.",

      description:
        "Swoop verifies users and ensures their email matches their name to ensure people are themselves. Additionally, Swoop protects against harm by only allowing people within your school domain to see you. A report feature is also included, so you can inform us of misuse of the app. Additionally, Swoop doesn't have a chat feature to ensure maximum safety.",

      header: "Low Pricing",
      description:
        "Swoop only charges you when you match with someone you like or reveal a match early. That's right; we only profit when you benefit. Thus you can try the app completely free, and future charges are minimal to fit the teenage budget. Also, the dream match is a free alternative to paid matches.",

The swipe cooldown is also designed in conjunction with the weekly reveal to minimize bullying. Swoop uses a weekly reveal, so you don't miss out on the anticipation of dating, but there always is the instant reveal for those of us who just can't wait.",
